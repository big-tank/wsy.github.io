    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "section": "Time to try Quarto",
    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

I obtained my PhD (thesis: Representation and Utilization of hospital Electronic Health Records data) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo in 2022. I am still working on EHR and antibiotics related projects, and I develop ggehr, a ggplot2 extension to visualizing EHR data.\nShortly after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, I joined Norwegian Institute of Public Health as a data scientist (R developer + statistician) for the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, Sykdomspulsen (now CSIDS). I am one of a founding members of CSIDS, the Consortium for Statistics in Disease Surveillance, where we build open source software for public health surveillance.\nSometimes I teach statistics courses (MF9130, MF9130E, ERN4110) at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology (OCBE), University of Oslo. As a certified Carpentries instructor, I also teach and help with R programming at the Carpentries workshops at University of Oslo. In 2023, I lead the transition of medical statistics classroom of MF9130E into open-source (read more).\nI am an active member of Oslo User R group and Oslo R ladies group.

Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"
